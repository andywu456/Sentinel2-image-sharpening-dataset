We offered a dataset that can be employed to assess the Sentinel-2 image sharpening models. The dataset comprises 17 Sentinel-2 scenes, with their acquisition dates and tile locations listed in Table 2 in the paper below. The 10/20/60-m bands of Sentinel-2 are included in the dataset. These scenes are collected over the four seasons in 2021 across China. Different spatial locations, elevation conditions, and acquisition dates ensure a diversity of land cover types and spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected data, based on which the image sharpening models can be fully tested. It is noteworthy that the image sharpening task over heterogeneous landscape with complex land covers is always considered challenging. Thus, we pay special attention to the heterogeneous landscape, such as fragmental farmlands, wetland areas, and urban regions, to reveal the sharpening performance of models in the challenging scenario.
